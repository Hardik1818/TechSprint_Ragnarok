# 📌 DailyPay Nepal — Salary Access Platform

DailyPay Nepal is a modern **Earned Wage Access (EWA)** platform developed under the **TechSprint Ragnarok** challenge. It enables employees in Nepal to access their **earned salary on a daily basis** instead of waiting for the traditional end-of-month payday.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In Nepal, most employees are paid on a **monthly salary system**, while daily expenses such as food, transportation, rent, and emergencies require immediate cash. This mismatch forces employees to:

- Take high-interest loans  
- Borrow money from friends or family  
- Depend on informal credit systems  

These issues create financial stress and reduce productivity.

---

## 💡 Solution

**DailyPay Nepal** allows employees to withdraw a portion of their **already earned salary each day**. Employers deposit the monthly salary into the system, and the platform automatically releases a fixed daily amount to employees.

### Benefits:
- Better cash flow management  
- Reduced debt dependency  
- Improved financial stability  
- No additional burden on employers  

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 💸 Daily salary disbursement  
- 👛 Secure digital wallet  
- 📊 Transaction history  
- 🔐 JWT-based authentication  
- 🧑‍💼 Role-based access (Admin & Employee)  
- 🔗 Ready for bank & digital wallet integration
