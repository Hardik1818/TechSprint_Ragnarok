# DailyPay Nepal

## Problem Statement
In Nepal, salaried employees receive their income only once a month, even though daily expenses like food, transport, and emergencies occur every day. This creates cash flow stress, forces people to borrow money at high interest, or rely on informal lending. Government and private employees, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, have no flexible access to their already-earned salary before payday.

## Solution
**DailyPay Nepal** is a salary access platform that allows employees to receive their earned salary on a daily basis instead of waiting for the end of the month. Organizations deposit the monthly salary into the platform at the beginning of the cycle, and the system automatically releases a fixed daily amount to employees’ wallets.

Employees can:
- Use the balance for digital payments  
- Transfer it to their bank account when needed  

This improves financial stability, reduces dependence on loans, and gives users better control over their own earnings **without increasing employer cost**.
